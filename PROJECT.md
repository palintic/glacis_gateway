Assignment
Estimated Effort: 3 hours


The Problem
Our supply chain platform integrates with dozens of external logistics and financial vendors. They send us real-time updates via webhooks, but every vendor sends data in completely different, undocumented, and unpredictable JSON structures.



AI Webhook Ingestion Service
Build a backend service that ingests vendor webhook payloads (see Appendix: Sample Payloads - attached below), determines what type of event occurred, normalizes the data into standard internal schemas using LLMs, and stores the result.



Classification
Classify webhooks into one of three types:

Shipment - any update about a physical parcel moving through a logistics network

Invoice - any financial document our platform owes, is owed, or has settled

Unclassified - anything that does not belong to either of the above



Entity Lifecycle
A shipment or invoice is not a single event, it produces a sequence of webhooks over hours or days (pickup, transit milestones, exceptions, delivery; or issued, paid, voided, refunded)

The canonical states are:

Shipment: PICKED_UP → IN_TRANSIT → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED

Invoice: ISSUED → PAID. Alternative terminal states: VOIDED (cancelled before payment) and REFUNDED (payment reversed after settlement)

Vendors do not use this vocabulary. One vendor says delivered; another says package handed to recipient. Your normalization layer must collapse vendor-specific language into the canonical state.



Environment realities: You are building for a production environment where things go wrong. Vendors expect sub-second acknowledgments when they send a webhook. However, they are also notorious for firing the exact same payload multiple times, and events frequently arrive completely out of order.



Core Requirements
Ingestion: Create an endpoint that accepts any arbitrary JSON payload.

Normalization: Use an LLM to evaluate the payload, classify the event, and normalize the data into a strict internal schema that you define.

Storage: Persist the normalized records in a database. Ensure your storage logic accounts for the environmental realities mentioned above.



Evaluation Criteria
System Design & Architecture: How you structure your application, define boundaries, and handle external dependencies.

Resiliency & Data Integrity: How your system handles the realities of distributed systems, concurrency, and imperfect integrations.

Architecture Document: Include a README.md detailing your architectural decisions, the specific trade-offs you made given the time constraints, and your roadmap for taking this to production.



Important Note: At Glacis, we build with AI to move faster. You are strongly encouraged to use AI tools for this assessment. Show us how you act as an architect and orchestrator, using AI to generate the foundation while you handle the tradeoffs and integration logic.



Submission
Please provide a link to a public GitHub repository with your code and the README.md.

(Optional) Share a short 2-3 min video walkthrough of your submission.
